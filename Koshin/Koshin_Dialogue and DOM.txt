**Here is all the Takeda-specific dialogue that I know is needed in a mod. If there's any more, please let me know.**

            Ah, this is a good day! I look forward to the day when we ride together out from the mountains.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_REJECT_DECLARE_FRIEND_FROM_HUMAN_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            Hmm… No, this will not do. Apologies.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_DECLARE_FRIEND_FROM_AI_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            We should declare our friendship to all the other powers in this world. There is no reason for the Takeda to fight you.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_ACCEPT_DECLARE_FRIEND_FROM_AI_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            Many thanks for your acceptance! Perhaps we can continue making arrangements elsewhere?
        
        LOC_DIPLO_REJECT_DECLARE_FRIEND_FROM_AI_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            Ah… Perhaps it was just my fevered hope.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_DECLARE_WAR_FROM_HUMAN_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            I am afraid that there can only be one victor in this age of warring states. That victor will be the Takeda, and I must make sure of it.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_DECLARE_WAR_FROM_AI_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            Your lands will make a fine addition to the Takeda empire, like Shinano before you.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_DEFEAT_FROM_AI_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            I leave my relatives in control of my armies for one second, and this happens? I should have known better. You deserve your victory.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_ACCEPT_DELEGATION_FROM_HUMAN_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            We accept your delegation. I shall send some of my men out to guide them through the mountain passes.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_REJECT_DELEGATION_FROM_HUMAN_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            What, and give you the secrets of the arts of the Takeda warriors? You must be joking.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_DELEGATION_FROM_AI_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            It is hard to grow rice in our lands, so we cannot send as rich a gift as others might. But, please accept this hoto and soba, and our delegation with it.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_DENOUNCE_FROM_HUMAN_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            You are nothing but an errant estate owner in the way of the Takeda.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_DENOUNCE_FROM_AI_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            What is it this time? Just because you have a coastline doesn’t mean you’re a match for the Takeda.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_FIRST_MEET_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            The people of Kai and Shinano welcome you, stranger. I am Daimyo Takeda Shingen, ruler of all under Mount Fuji. Tell me, which lands are yours?
        
        LOC_DIPLO_FIRST_MEET_VISIT_RECIPIENT_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            Please, come with me to Kai! We have many wonderful hot springs hidden away in our mountains.
        
        LOC_DIPLO_FIRST_MEET_NEAR_INITIATOR_POSITIVE_LEADER_SHINGEN_ANY 
            You have our thanks.
			
			
*Dawn of Man Quote*
The great mountains of your home beckon to you, Lord Harunobu, ruler of the proud Takeda. Your people may be rightly known for their skill when in the saddle, but every man in Japan’s heartland fears the Takeda for their unarmed lethality and effective domain control in equal measure. Take on the mantle of Shingen, O great daimyo, and be as the wind, as a forest, as fire, and as a mountain.

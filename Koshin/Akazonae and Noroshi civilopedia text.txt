Civilopedia Text - Akazonae
Although the term ‘akazonae’ can be used to refer to any samurai clad in red lacquered armour, the term has become associated with the armies of the Takeda in particular. Notable Takeda akazonae include those led by the Sanada and by Yamagata Masakage (one of Takeda Shingen’s famous Twenty-Four Generals), the latter also being the origin of the term ‘fire cavalry’ sometimes used to refer to Takeda charge cavalry. [new paragraph] The Takeda were well known as having the best mounted samurai in Japan during the Sengoku period. With the help of these troops, some of them akazonae, Shingen managed to expand his domain from Kai to Shinano, Suruga, and even parts of Kozuke and Totomi. However, his successor Katsuyori was convinced – despite the Generals’ disagreement – that cavalry charges could defeat any enemy of the Takeda, which was proven wrong when the clan lost half its army in 1575 to Oda Nobunaga and his anti-cavalry barricades.



Civilopedia Text - Noroshi
A noroshi is a type of medieval signalling beacon pioneered by Takeda Shingen during the Sengoku period. It consists of a small wooden tower attached to a long, mobile pole, which in turn has a bucket attached to one end. To operate the noroshi, the bucket would be lowered to the ground by swinging the pole with a rope system operated from the top of the tower. The bucket would then be filled with burning material and hoisted about 25 metres into the sky, thus creating a signal easily visible to people on nearby noroshi. The Takeda set up noroshi all over Koshin, and thus were able to – for example – transmit news of an attack in Kawanakajima on the Uesugi border to the capital at Kofu in under two hours.
